# Projections and Coordinate Reference Systems

At the end of this exercise students will be able to:

* Use the *Project* tool to transform geographic data to a new projection
* Create a page layout with multiple data frames in different projections

- Interrupted Goode Homolosine (an **equivalent** projection)
- World Mercator (a **conformal** projection)
- Robinson (a **compromise** projection)
