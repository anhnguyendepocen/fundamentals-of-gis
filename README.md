# fundamentals-of-gis

This repository contains lab exercises for an introductory class in Geographic Information Systems taught at [Temple University](http://temple.edu/)'s Department of [Geography and Urban Studies](http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/).

Many of the lab exercises were originally designed by Jeremy Mennis. Various versions have been floating around in our department with contributions or modifications by Hamil Pearsall, Charlie Kaylor, Kevin Henry, and possibly others. These labs have been converted to markdown by Lee Hachadoorian and posted here.

We have attempted to genericize the labs, so that they can be used apart from any particular lab setting. This means that lab numbers and due dates have been removed, so that individual instructors can use them as is in different semesters, or remove, add, or reorder the lab exercises without changing the numbering. A suggested progression is:

1. Introduction to ArcGIS (1 week)
2. Mapping in ArcGIS (1 week)
3. Managing Coordinate Systems (1 week)
4. Working with Relational Databases (1 week)
5. Vector Data Analysis (2 weeks)
6. Vector Operations (2 weeks)
7. Introduction to Raster GIS (2 weeks)

## Data


Most lab exercises rely upon Pennsylviania and Philadelphia-area data. At the moment, many of the labs still have data instructions at the beginning that will need to be rewritten or removed. 

Data is not currently hosted on GitHub, but will be made available soon, either on GitHub or an external file hosting site.
