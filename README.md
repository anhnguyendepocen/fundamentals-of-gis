This repository contains lab exercises for an introductory class in Geographic Information Systems taught at [Temple University](http://temple.edu/)'s Department of [Geography and Urban Studies](http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/).

As of Summer 2017, the lab exercises are undergoing significant revision. When completed, this message will be removed. Until that time, some lab exercises may be out of sequence with the rest of the exercises.

We have attempted to genericize the labs, so that they can be used apart from any particular lab setting. This means that the exercises do not include due dates, course numbers, instructor names, etc. The exercises are intended to be completed in the following sequence:

1. Introduction to ArcGIS (1-2 weeks)
2. Projections and Coordinate Reference Systems (1 week)
3. Thematic Cartography (1 week)
4. Tables and Attribute Data (2 weeks)
5. Digitization/Creating and Editing Map Data (2 weeks)
6. Vector Operations/Overlay Analysis (2 weeks)
7. Introduction to Raster Analysis (2 weeks)
8. GIS Programming with ArcGIS ModelBuilder (1-2 weeks)

The above list will be include links to the lab exercises when they are completed.

## The old progression

1. Introduction to ArcGIS (1 week)
2. Mapping in ArcGIS (1 week)
3. Managing Coordinate Systems (1 week)
4. Working with Relational Databases (1 week)
5. Vector Data Analysis (2 weeks)
6. Vector Operations (2 weeks)
7. Introduction to Raster GIS (2 weeks)
